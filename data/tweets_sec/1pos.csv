48,MMScholes,"Yikes! @PlacerCA residents - BIG spike in COVID-19 cases today (41) - our largest number yet. PLEASE wear a mask to slow the spread. Also note - our Congressman @RepMcClintock refuses to wear a mask citing ""personal choice"" even though it would save #CA04 lives. #WearAMask "

2,MsButterflyyy,FL marked a daily death record when the sheriff brilliantly decided to ban employees/office visitors from wearing masks after speaking w/Trump. Has anyone told this sheriff #coronavirus is not afraid of a gun or a badge? #WearAMask #BeTheChange4USA 
10,XKataquapit,The most important aspect of wearing masks I am discovering is the psychology behind them. They keep people apart and it sends a message to everyone to be vigilant. If adopted and shared it also gives people something visible they can do for others. @gcfiddler #WearAMask
94,V2019N,A frightening interview with a president in denial about the ongoing pandemic. If you live in the US protect yourself and your family. Stay home and if you have to go out #WearAMask.
