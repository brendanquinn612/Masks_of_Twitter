2,mrjc1,I’m out in public. #NoMask Come and get me.
10,MyMassacre,Just got back from my local co-op. Lovely to see two other barefaced shoppers. The more I do it the easier it becomes. I felt liberated. #NoMask #showyoursmile
26,Anjlefire,How many days left to “flatten the curve” at this point? Asking for a few million Americans. #NoMask
11,BardsFM,Final word today on @POTUS and @FLOTUS masks... Whatever their reason I don't know and I don't care... because in the end #WeThePeople must decide our future... not @POTUS or @FLOTUS. They are elected they are not kings queens or Gods. Masks = enslavement. #NoMask #GodWins
13,kiwiskiNZ,My contribution to the #Mask #NoMask #COVID19 debate.
28,Loriaof,I will not wear a mask here. I will not wear a mask there. I will not wear a mask anywhere! #NoMask
1,EastCoastMods,At Walmart today and a woman couldn't reach the Ginger Ale on the top shelf. She asked me to get it for her. I did so with no gloves and no mask on. She wasn't afraid when I handed it to her either. #COVID19 #NoGloves #NoMask #DontBeAfraid
